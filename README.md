This is a minimal example that shows how to use the C++/Tree
mapping to access XML instance documents described by XML Schema
definitions for a basic IHP-Open-PDK component.

The example consists of the following files:

basicihp.xsd

  XML Schema which was autogenerated using the following [tool](https://www.liquid-technologies.com/online-xml-to-xsd-converter) 
  and a `basicihp.xml` file .

basicihp.xml
  Sample XML instance document which contains a component definition.

basicihp.hxx
basic.cxx
  C++ types that represent the given vocabulary and a set of parsing
  functions that convert XML instance documents to a tree-like in-memory
  object model.

  These files are generated by the XSD compiler from basicihp.xsd using the
  following cmake and CMakeLists.txt file. 

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It first calls one of the parsing functions
  that constructs the object model from the input file. It then prints
  the content of the object model to STDERR.

To compile and link the example manually from the command line we can use
the following commands (replace 'c++' with your C++ compiler name):
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
```

To run the example on the sample XML instance document execute:
```
./driver ../hello.xml
```

TO generate C++ tree exec:
xsd cxx-tree mos.xsd
